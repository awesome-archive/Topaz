    <p align="center"> <b>A configurable, easy to maintain personal website</b> </p>
</p>


**Live example**: https://naresh1318.com

After working on a project the last thing I usually think of is updating my personal website. 
Adding links, images, description and pushing changes to the server every single time I work 
on something new is kinda boring especially if you are lazy like me. What do we do when we're lazy?
we automate things. Thereby giving us time to, idk, complain about our laziness. I designed Topaz 
to automatically update as much of my website as possible.

### Recent updates:
* Admin page lets you choose projects you want to display (thanks [@abhinuvpitale](https://github.com/abhinuvpitale)
* Github stars added on project cards
* Github primary language added to project cards

## Here's what it can currently do:

1. Automatically fetch public repos from your github account

<p align=center>
    <img src="https://files.naresh1318.com/public/projects.png" alt="simplyServe"/>
    <p align="center"> <b>Projects from github</b> </p>
</p>

2. Admin page that lets you easily add blogs and publication details

    <p align="center"> <b>Add blogs and publications details</b> </p>
</p>

3. Choose what gets shown

    <p align="center"> <b>Manage what gets shown</b> </p>
</p>


4. Customize website by editing `theme.json` file

```json
{
  "name": "Naresh Nagabushan",
  "icon": "./static/img/personal-website-logo.png",
  "name_font_family": "Beth Ellen",
  "font_family": "Source Sans Pro",
  "nav_bar": "#101010",
  "recent_activity_cards": "#f1f1f1",
  "project_cards": "#f1f1f1",
  "blog_cards": "#f1f1f1",
  "publication_cards": "#f1f1f1",
  "resume_url": "https://files.naresh1318.com/public/Me/Naresh_Nagabushan.pdf",
  "github_url": "https://github.com/Naresh1318",
  "medium_url": "https://medium.com/@rnaresh.n",
  "linkedin_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/naresh-nagabushan-2946b013a",
  "twitter_url": "https://twitter.com/Naresh_Reddy_"
}
```
4. Mobile friendly (currently working on this)

## Here are the things that I'm still working on:

1. Automatically fetch blogs from medium
2. Fetch publication from google scholar
3. \# Your thoughtful suggestions go here :)


## Install
Super easy as always. Clone before you start!

1. Edit theme.json file to reflect what you want. Here's another example:

```json
{
  "name": "Alice & Bob",
  "icon": "./static/img/my-dope-icon.png",
  "name_font_family": "Beth Ellen",
  "font_family": "Source Sans Pro",
  "nav_bar": "#101010",
  "recent_activity_cards": "#101010",
  "project_cards": "#101010",
  "blog_cards": "#101010",
  "publication_cards": "#101010",
  "resume_url": "https://files.naresh1318.com/public/Me/what_ever.pdf",
  "github_url": "https://github.com",
  "medium_url": "https://medium.com",
  "linkedin_url": "https://www.linkedin.com",
  "twitter_url": "https://twitter.com"
}
```

2. Generate a github token by visiting this link: https://github.com/settings/tokens 
and select the repo checkbox. Give it a name if you want and copy the token.

3. cd into the project root dir and paste the key into a keys.txt file
```bash
echo "token <your key>" >> keys.txt
```

4. Install docker if you don't have it already using this link: 
https://docs.docker.com/install/ or just google it for your os

5. Add an admin account

   * Open any editor and modify `Dockerfile`:

     ```bash
        ENV USERNAME "<username>"
        ENV PASSWORD "<password>"
     ```

4. Build your image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t <image name>:<tag> .
   ```

   Here's how mine looks:

   ```bash
   docker build -t topaz:latest .
   ```

5. Run your image:

   ```bash
   docker run -p <port to forward>:5000 -v absolute path to data dir in project:/app/data/ <image name>:<tag>
   ```

   Here's mine:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 4000:5000 -v /home/naresh/Projects/Topaz/data/:/app/data/ topaz:latest

6. Finally, go to `localhost:<port forwarded to>` on your browser

7. You can access the login page using `localhost:<port forwarded to>/login`. Example `localhost:4000\login`. 
Login using the username and password you setup earlier.
